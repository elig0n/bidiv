Release 1.5: Jan 7, 2006
  * Fixed buffer size error that caused buffer overflows (and crashes) in
    certain cases. Thanks to Dan Kenigsberg and to Shachar Raindel for
    reporting the bug and suggesting patches.
  * Update bidiv(1) manual to reflect bidiv's UTF8 capabilities (that already
    existed in release 1.4).
  * Clarify GPL license in bidiv.c and README, and include GPL's "COPYING"
    license file in the bidiv distribution.

Release 1.4: Oct 21, 2002
  * Fix auto direction so that if the first line of a paragraph has no
    direction, the direction of the previous paragraph is used temporarily.
    See tests/1. (Nadav Har'El)
  * utf8 is output (instead of iso8859-8) when LC_CTYPE is something.UTF-8.
    Note that if both the input and output is utf8, then it may contain
    things other than Hebrew, with no ill-effects. Currently no option to
    force utf8 (or iso8859-8) output other then changing the locale.
  * When the first character was nonascii didn't look like a Hebrew character, 
    we assumed it and the next character compose utf8. But when this doesn't
    make sense (e.g., the second character is ascii, e.g., a newline) we ruined
    two characters. Better ruin only one by our transformation :)

Release 1.3: Apr 17, 2001
